# FileTypeOrganization
Organizes a filesystem by file type, makes analysis of a system easier for xyz

thought something like this could be used to do analysis of a system visually much easier

- enter program name, and a source location (where you wish to look) and the destination (where you wish to save)
- The Program will go through a directory and collect all file types, and filenames
- Next the program will create a directories within the destination location and begin to copy files to that location
- The Program Ends


[Warning, will not work in VS Debug mode... idk why yet]
