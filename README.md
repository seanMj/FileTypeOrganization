# FileTypeOrganization (Runs on Windows And Linux without any changes)
Organize a filesystem by file type, makes analysis of a system easier for people who need to quickly comb through a system that isn't their own, or people who just want to run a program for fun. 

thought something like this could be used to do analysis of a system visually much easier

- enter program name, and a source location (where you wish to look) and the destination (where you wish to save)
- The Program will go through a directory and collect all file types, and filenames
- Next the program will create a directories within the destination location and begin to copy files of type T, to that location
- The Program Ends (program runs relatively fast and without hassle. 

To run program in command line: 

     FileTypeOrganization <whereToLook> <WhereToSave>
    
     Where To Look is where you want the program to find the files for searching through.
     
     Where To Look is where the program will save the organized file data. 


not really done the way I like to write code, but im trying to impress a girl for the first time with my uniqueness of mind instead, and think this is how?
